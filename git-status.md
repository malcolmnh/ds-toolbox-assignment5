## Definition: git status   
The git status command gives an overview of any files that have been modified, files that have been added to the staging area, and files that have been commited.  
The information given in the git status output is also available in the git extension of Jupyter Lab under the Changes tab with the files showing under the Staged (added), Changed, or Untracked sub-tabs.
